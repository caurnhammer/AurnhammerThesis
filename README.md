This repository contains the code and data necessary to reproduce the analyses of my PhD thesis.

# Code

The code/ directory contains experiment-independent code to run and visualize regression analyses following the idea of rERPs. There are implementations of both least-squares regression and linear mixed effects regression and specifications for electroencephalography (EEG) and self-paced reading data.
Regression modeling is done in julia, visualisation and multiple comparisons correction is done in R.

# Data

The data are provided as a release within this repository.

# Language and package versions
